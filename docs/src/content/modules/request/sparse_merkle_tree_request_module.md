# Sparse Merkle Tree Request Module

See [ISparseMerkleTreeRequestModule.sol](/solidity/interfaces/modules/request/ISparseMerkleTreeRequestModule.sol/interface.ISparseMerkleTreeRequestModule.md) for more details.

## 1. Introduction

The `SparseMerkleTreeRequestModule` is a contract that allows a user to request the calculation of a Merkle tree after inserting a set of leaves.

## 2. Contract Details

### Key Methods

- `decodeRequestData(bytes calldata _data)`: This function decodes the request data for a given request ID. It returns a RequestParameters struct that contains the parameters for the request.
- `finalizeRequest(bytes32 _requestId, address _finalizer)`: This function is called by the Oracle to finalize the request. It either pays the proposer for the response or releases the requester's bond if no response was submitted.

### Request Parameters

- `treeData`: The encoded Merkle tree data parameters for the tree verifier.
- `leavesToInsert`: The array of leaves to insert into the Merkle tree.
- `treeVerifier`: The tree verifier to calculate the root.
- `accountingExtension`: The accounting extension to use for the request.
- `paymentToken`: The payment token to use for the request.
- `paymentAmount`: The payment amount to use for the request.

## 3. Key Mechanisms & Concepts

The `SparseMerkleTreeRequestModule` uses a Merkle tree to calculate the root from a set of leaves. The verified contract is used to calculate the Merkle root hash given a set of Merkle tree branches and Merkle tree leaves count.

## 4. Gotchas

- The module is supposed to be paired with the root verification module.
- The verifier contract must follow the `ITreeVerifier` interface, otherwise the proposers won't be able to calculate the correct response.
